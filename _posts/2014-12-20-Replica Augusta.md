title: Replica Augusta
---

Reckon it’s true that when someone dies or you stop knowing them, they move away or something, you remember them at all points in their life as how they were when you last saw them. Washington Latterbee, who built his own golf course, was at least fifty when he died and it’s easy to forget he wasn’t always that age.

The way to explain Latterbee is that his parents gave him a funny name like Washington and consequently he spent his entire life believing he was destined for great things. And maybe he was, though I don’t believe in anything like destiny. Latterbee would have settled for what the rest of us do had he been named something regular. As the facts have it, he wasn’t and he didn’t.

Truth is none of us knew of the existence of Washington Latterbee until he came to this part of Texas in ninety-one. Twenty-some years, that’s not even so long ago. He was a stranger out here. Couldn’t always understand what he was saying because he always had a mouth full of chewing tobacco. Near incomprehensible at times when he was excited and talking too fast or drunk. Drank straight through the wad of tobacco. Didn’t take it out of his mouth.

He said was raised in a different part of the state, but I don’t know that that’s true. Worked on golf courses he said. Planned to build one. Worked as a caddy? That was hard to believe, rough type like him. No, he said, a groundskeeper. Planned on building a course of his own.

He’d bought a whole heap of land out on the route twenty-nine.  Saved his whole life to buy enough land for his course. Been working since he was sixteen he said. Had a doublewide out there on it. Had dug a well. 

Twenty-nine’s that short little highway that goes between the two majors. It’s supposed to be called Thomas Gaines Deacon Memorial Highway. No one I ever heard calls it that. The father of Thomas Gaines Deacon sits outside that gas station near mile five and tells everyone who stops there that they better sure tell people when they tell them that they drove on the Thomas Gaines Deacon Memorial Highway and that they better not say route twenty-nine because it isn’t called that anymore. Anyway with Latterbee building a golf course, there were now two crazy people assosciated with route twenty-nine.

He intended to build an exact replica of Augusta National, where the Masters is played. He’d worked there he said, back in eighty-eight, and was proud of it. Best course in America, that was for sure. None of us knew any better and frankly none cared to argue even if we had.

Getting blueprints he said would be the hard part. He pulled out of his pocket a piece of magazine paper which he’d folded and unfolded many times. I mean the creases were near torn. On it were little green drawings of each of the holes. This was an advertisement for a video game he told us. The game has it so you can play all eighteen holes. That was the big catchphrase of the advertisement. Play All Eighteen.

There was a computer store out of town on the way to Austin, attached next to an adult video store. We told him you could see the big neon sign for the video store from the highway. Its neon and you can’t miss it. Pink neon silhouette of a girl’s legs on. Someone swore that the legs were neon green but the rest of us weren’t sure or wouldn’t say.

The same guy owned both stores, Latterbee said after he’d been there. So Latterbee would go I don’t know how many times a week and take the video game from the computer store and then go next door where they had little booths usually for you know watching the videos. Latterbee would hookup the video game machine to the television and take his notes. Went on doing this every night, or almost every night, I have to suppose.

He showed us the notes he was taking. Real detailed. Made drawings. The hard part was elevation, he said. Game doesn’t do a good job showing elevation. But said that Marky, who owned the bar where we were presently drinking, was going to tape part of the Masters for him. That way he could see it and make measurements and comparisons. See the golf club or the players can be used like measuring sticks, Latterbee explained. Jack Nicklaus is five foot ten for example. You get a shot of him and you got yourself a scale for elevation. He was real excited by all of this. It’ll crack everything wide open, he kept saying. Wide open. None of us figured how he was going build the damn thing. Afford the grass seed or water or even move all that land around. Make the hills.

All spring and all summer I guess he was shoveling dirt around. Didn’t come by anymore. Then one day in September we heard some news about him.

Paul Rogers came in one Friday night and told us all about it. Supposedly what happened was some girl he’d known in Carolina came driving all the way from the coast with a little child, a little baby girl, one year old if even. Girl just dropped it off with him. Your fault, your child, was what she had said. Don’t know how she tracked him down, but I suppose there’s ways of doing so when it’s important. Maybe Latterbee’d told her where he was. Called her, wrote letters. I don’t know. He’d never talked about anything but golf. College football on occassion, sure.

Then the mother just drove off. Didn’t even tell him the poor child’s name. Wasn’t no birth certificate either. No birthday, but he had been able to make a pretty good guess said Paul Rogers. It’d only been once or twice. But like I said he didn’t talk about it with us. Like I said we only heard because Paul Rogers came talking about Latterbee having a lot of trouble and coming to him to get everything sorted legally. Came into the office for days in a row to get everything worked out. Kept Latterbee from working on the course a whole four days. But I got him all squared away, Paul Rogers said. 

Then in November he came into town to the Salvation Army with his little girl. This is Anna, he said. The golf course’s almost finished too. Well still got to grow the grass.

Little Anna was a happier girl than she had any right to be, I would say. We are getting a coat, she said. Because it gets cold in winter. Poor child.

That Spring a couple of us came out to see the course. None of us golf, but it didn’t matter. Lute said he plays but he doesn’t. Anyway the course was smaller than a normal golf course and you don’t need to be five-foot-ten Jack Nicklaus to know that. Nah, one-twelfth scale Latterbee said. Exact model replica of Augusta. Well except the greens and greens bunkers are normal size. And the holes themselves of course. You could play the whole thing with a pitch wedge and a putter. It was way too big to be miniature golf but it was not real golf either. In-between he said. Didn’t know what to call it, but it was a good time. Don’t have to worry about your yardage he said. How far you can drive it, he meant. God, dirty minds in the place today. But it wasn’t a game of strength.

Was still planning on building a full course. Had enough land to do it. But he needed more money. Needed a machine to move the land. Didn’t have the resources or the time at the moment. Needed to feed the child and make sure she was taken care of. Make sure she was raised right. Grass seed could add up if you were making an entire course. So he’d made the replica August instead.

He and the child were living in his doublewide trailer planted about a hundred yards up a dirt road from the edge of the property. The replica Augusta was in the front left corner. It was a funny looking terrain to see driving up. Sculpted and undulating. Come out again this weekend, he said, and play a round for free.

We did and did have a good time. He had maybe fifty clubs he’d bought from thrift shops over the years. Had his own set too. No one else was allowed to use those. Higher quality clubs he said. Real finds. Talked about how he’d gotten this one for $6.50 in Athens, or that one for four bucks some place outside Charleston. But the others he loaned to us for free for use on the replica Augusta. Only needed two clubs anyway.

Say Latterbee, people were often telling him those days, you might have something here. For a while it was a good time and not busy and we could play whenever we wanted. Started taking it pretty serious. Kept a leaderboard of record scores. Wooden boards he painted white. You’d get a white plaque with holes drilled in the top corners and he’d paint your name on it. Put it up on nails and move it up and down if you scored well enough.

And for a couple years that was all it was. Too busy with the child he said. Early years are real important, he said.

Before Kindergarten he said proudly that Anna was reading. He’d taught her himself. Child’s going be a great person, he said. Going to college, that’s for certain. They didn’t have no television, he said. Important not to. He went to the library and got Shakespeare audio tapes then went over to the adult video store and had Gerald copy the tapes for him. Told us all about it with customary detail. Child listened to those sometimes. No television he said. Brain poison. We were pretty sure the poor child was going to grow a mess now, hearing conspiracy theories. And growing up beside a replica Augusta. No mother already and now Macbeth and Hamlet. Sure going to grow up real strange.

But she didn’t, got to say. She grew up just fine. He did sure push that child though academically. Latterbee was a smart man if an uneducated one. Or he knew the right things if he didn’t exhibit them himself. Whenever Latterbee had parent teacher conferences all through elementary school he asked the schoolteacher if Anna was the best in the class. He said that he asked very calmy and pleasantly so the schoolteacher would be honest and not feel pressured to say something nice for the child’s sake. Bought her books from Salvation Army. Three books for a dollar. Can’t be that, he said. Went to library twice a week too. Child was great at math too, he said. In third grade was helping him measure and survey for his full-scale course.

He was always talking about the full-scale course. Till Anna was ten all he ever did talk about it. Didn’t build nothing. The old course had started making him good money too. Can’t say whether it was enough for construction, for what he had in mind, but I imagine so. Seemed more the child that he was worried about. Always saying how he had to get her set up in a boarding school. The course was getting busy too and maybe he didn’t have time to start building the other one. Lots of people playing it every weekend and he charged ten dollars a round. Put up a sign on the highway so people wouldn’t miss the turn down.

Then there was the article in Golf Magazine or Golf Digest. Something like that. Some publication. Anyway he bought twenty copies of it. Little column about his replica Augusta. He was damn lucky he said to be not so far out of the way as to make it irrelevant. Veritable crowds came some weekends during the good months. Folks coming to play the actual Augusta greens, he said. The rest was a novelty, one-tenth scale, but the greens were accurate. Of course we wouldn’t have known if he’d been lying. Turns out the greens really were correct. Magazine people had photographed and compared them. Real golfers came to play on them. Latterbee raised prices.

In the year two-thousand, he bought a second doublewide and put it way back on the property, way out of sight. Anna and him moved their living back there and cleaned up the old one and made it the office of operations for replica Augusta.

When Anna finished elementary school, the two of them drove all the way up to New England and Latterbee got her into a boarding school just like he’d said he would. Didn’t need to pay them or anything, he said proudly. Child so smart they took her free. Financial aid scholarship, yessir. 

Now, he said, it was high time to start on his full course.

Didn’t talk about a full copy of Augusta anymore. Wanted to build his own. Latterbee said how there was a sustainable environmental course that’d been built up in Nebraska. Low maintenance, natural grass, didn’t use that much water. Said he’d designed his own. Or was designing his own.

Going to use the best parts from all the best courses round the world, he said. He tapped his breast pocket like the blueprints were right there in it.

Bought an old bulldozer from a bankruptcy auction out west somewhere near the state line. Hired a kid from the high school to run replica Augusta while he built his full scale. We didn’t see him come round all Fall, Winter or Spring. I myself only went out to play replica Augusta couple times. High school kid said he was out there working. You could faintly hear the bulldozer, but you couldn’t see it. It was over a hill, over out of view moving earth.

Spent everyday for a year sitting in that old bulldozer driving around the property. Pushing stuff here and there. The idea, he had said, was to move a little land as possible. Sure seemed like he was moving a lot of land. Said it was part of the sustainability of the thing. Land is already where nature wants it to be, he said. Moving it only makes trouble.

One day end of June, round about when Anna was supposed to be coming back from school for the summer break, Latterbee came in to solicit my expertise regarding irrigation. Wanted to build himself a water tower. Obviously the old well wasn’t going to work servicing a full course.

Well, damn, I said, how’d had he been watering the greens of replica Augusta all these years.

We drove back out to his land. He showed me the water tank he’d load up on the back of that one golf cart he owned. He had a sprinkler he’d built onto the tank and the whole thing ran off the golf cart engine. It was a John Deere tractor engine he said. Switched it out. Thing drives like a rocket. Fixed the whole thing up himself and was proud of it. 

Greens and fairways were two different animals, though, he said. Can’t expect to cover that type of area with his old methods. Needed something proper.

Said how he’d been told for years to talk to investors. Get some more money. Said he hadn’t never taken loans when he needed them, not for a dollar, and wasn’t going to take them now that he didn’t.

We drove around the new course in the cart. He sure hadn’t been lying about the John Deere. Thing flew.

Course sure didn’t look all that impressive. It was all brown, mostly. Latterbee was proud of it though. One of the best courses in the world, he told me. I don’t know anything about golf courses so I believed him and didn’t the same amount. The course was mostly the browngold field grass we have out here. He’d cut down a couple trees he said. Not more than two dozen though. There were some bunkers he dug. Latterbee’s greens were bright emerald spots here and there. Not for them, it’d be easy to mistake the whole course for a wild field. Or an old battlefield I guess you could say, if you call the bunker holes places shells landed. He showed me the places he thought might be best for the water tower. Might be thinking of building two, he said, except he said growing two before correcting himself.

Latterbee never convinced any of us he was completely alright. Takes an off-type to go build himself a golf course. The way he talked about that golf course he seemed to think it had great importance. Like it held some promise of solving the great troubles of the world. He talked about as if he was doing god’s work. Building an ark or something.

He had sure been singular minded about raising that child, too. Soon as she was done with fifth grade he’d made sure she got away so he wouldn’t mess it up. So she spent all her adolescense all the way up at that school in Massachusetts. Then at another school for high school. He’d done his ten good years he said. School can do the rest. People pay tens of thousands of dollars for those places he said. Fool like me would be an idiot not to believe it’s worth it.

Anna came back every summer though, and worked around the golf course with her father. Never golfed herself, not that type of girl, but she helped out cutting the grass. Latterbee taughter her to walk the greens. Did that couple early mornings every week before opening. Got to keep the grass perfect for the greens. He paid her same as the high school kids he hired each summer for replica Augusta.

Don’t remember what year it opened but the main course was popular almost immediately. Latterbee said he’d gotten pros to come out there to play it. Tom Watson was out last weekend, he said. He’d gotten the Golf Digest reviewers out there to play. Gotten the course reviewed in all the magazines made a real name for himself. Guess golfers stayed in Austin or someplace and drove out to play it. Didn’t see them around town anyway.

One day in 2007 Latterbee comes in showing us how his course, his course that’d been sitting out there between his two doublewides, was ranked by the magazine the seventh best course in all of the United States. In the magazine it was typed up as Anna’s Old Course, TX, USA. That’s what he’d named it he said. Anna’s Old Course. Latterbee was very proud of the name. You call it the Old Course, he said, so people immediately think there’s a new course somewhere and that this is the original one.

He’d bought a cell phone, he said, because people wanted to call him. Business opportunities, he said. People wanted to buy him out. People want to have tournaments. Willing to pay him more money than any of us had known for the land and the course. Don’t know that he wanted to sell. Got the feeling he’d rather keep driving around in his John Deere rocketship and keep building the place up. He was too proud of it all. Probably dreamed of hosting some tour event. Getting his course in a video game.

Anna was about to go to college. Girl was as smart as they come, Latterbee said. Never paid a dime for her schools. Never a dime. Most ever paid was driving up to Massachusetts to get her accepted in the first place. Taught her fractions myself, he said. When she was five taught her how to mix fuels for the different machines.

She’d grown up to be more beautiful than he’d hoped, he said. It was trouble. Her mother was from Carolina but Anna had long Texas hair. Thankfully dark brown not blonde, Latterbee said. Her mother was blonde, he said. That had always got him into trouble.

She was going to be a doctor he said. A doctor. Take care of me when I’m old, Latterbee said.

Wasn’t he already old? 

And don’t I know it, he said. Knees basically gone. Feels like it. What do I know? Ran over my left foot couple years back. Think one of the bones didn’t heal right.

Latterbee sold the course to some rich development group out of Dallas on the condition that he be made chief groundskeeper and be allowed to retain ownership of the doublewide trailers and be given a place for them on the edge of the property. Sufficiently hidden from view, he said the language read. He also got contracted to design a second course in his style up near Dallas. Anna’s New Course. Said he got a lot of ideas. Had a dozen notebooks of hole designs, placements. I got all sorts of things in store for the New Course, he said.

The development group that owned Anna’s Old Course was deciding whether to get rid of replica Augusta or not. Some liked it. Perfect for teaching kids. Bring them out they can play on it while the grown-ups play the real course. Some of the developers said it was a gimmick and it had to go. It’s silly, they said. It was taking up a lot of valuable space near the front of the property. Could put two million worth in real estate on that space. Everything was up in the air. They’d bought the adjacent lot. Building clubhouses, residences, putting in irrigation, cart paths, little ball washers, a maintenance barn and a full grounds team. Planting more trees inbetween holes. Some of the greens had to be redone. More work than ever, Latterbee said. They planned on closing from Veterans ’til March. They’d already started construction end of the summer. In the end, replica Augusta got plowed over.

Not a year later, Latterbee had died. Middle of construction on the New Course. Never did hear for sure what killed him. Cancer’d be my guess. Always did have a cheek of chewing tobacco. Anyway, Anna had just started college and was left alone in the world, poor girl. No family, no idea who her mother was or how to find her, owned nothing but her scholarship, two doublewide trailers that sat in the corner of a golf course that bore her name, and those casettes her father’d once made of the complete works of William Shakespeare. Almost too sad to bear, if you ask me. Anyway, she was home once, for the funeral. After that, we never saw Anna Latterbee come through again.
